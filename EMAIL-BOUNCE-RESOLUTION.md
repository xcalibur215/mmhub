# Supabase Email Bouncing Issue - Resolution Guide

## Issue Summary
Your Supabase project (wkjshlcwstzxvxnvowby) has detected a high rate of bounced emails from transactional emails, which may result in temporary email sending restrictions.

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Disable Email Verification for Development
For development environments, you should disable email verification to prevent bounced emails.

**Steps:**
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/wkjshlcwstzxvxnvowby
2. Navigate to Authentication > Settings
3. Under "User signups" section:
   - Set "Enable email confirmations" to **OFF** for development
4. Under "Email Auth" section:
   - Ensure you're using valid test email addresses

### 2. Set Up Custom SMTP Provider (Recommended)
Instead of using Supabase's default email service, configure a custom SMTP provider:

**Recommended Providers:**
- **SendGrid** (Free tier: 100 emails/day)
- **Mailgun** (Free tier: 5,000 emails/month)
- **Amazon SES** (Very low cost)
- **Resend** (Free tier: 3,000 emails/month)

**Configuration Steps:**
1. Go to Authentication > Settings > SMTP Settings
2. Enable "Enable custom SMTP"
3. Configure your SMTP provider settings:
   ```
   Host: [Your provider's SMTP host]
   Port: 587 (or your provider's port)
   Username: [Your SMTP username]
   Password: [Your SMTP password]
   Sender name: MMHub
   Sender email: noreply@yourdomain.com
   ```

### 3. Implement Email Validation in Your Application
Add client-side email validation to prevent invalid emails from being submitted.

### 4. Use Valid Test Emails Only
For testing purposes, always use valid email addresses that you own and can verify.

### 5. Environment-Specific Configuration
Set up different email handling for development vs production:

**Development:**
- Disable email verification
- Use console logging instead of sending emails
- Use valid test addresses for any required email testing

**Production:**
- Enable email verification with custom SMTP
- Implement proper email validation
- Monitor bounce rates regularly

## Long-term Solutions

### 1. Email Address Validation
Implement both client-side and server-side email validation:
- Format validation (regex)
- Domain validation
- Disposable email detection
- Real-time validation using services like ZeroBounce or EmailJS

### 2. Double Opt-in Process
Implement a double opt-in process for user registrations to ensure email validity.

### 3. Regular Monitoring
Set up monitoring for:
- Bounce rates
- Spam complaints  
- Email delivery rates
- User engagement with emails

### 4. Email List Hygiene
Regularly clean your email lists:
- Remove bounced emails
- Remove inactive subscribers
- Segment users based on engagement

## Quick Fix for Current Issue

1. **Immediate:** Disable email verification in Supabase dashboard
2. **Short-term:** Set up SendGrid or similar SMTP provider
